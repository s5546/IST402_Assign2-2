<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1316</p>

<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1316 is to be the only SCP object contained at Bio Containment Site 39. It is to be housed in a 2.5 x 2 x 1.5&nbsp;m enclosure constructed from radio frequency (RF) shielding material. A single radio receiver is to be placed in the containment area of SCP-1316 in order to record all transmissions. Access to recordings of the transmissions of SCP-1316 is contingent upon approval of at least two Level 4 personnel. Feedings are to take place twice daily, while litter is to be changed every three days by a single D-Class personnel. Only D-Class personnel may come within 10 meters of SCP-1316.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1316 is a female <em>Felis catus</em>, or common house cat. It exhibits no unusual behavior besides a marked friendliness to strangers. Despite having been in Foundation custody since 1948, it is physiologically identical to a three-month-old kitten, and shows no signs of aging. Upon acquisition by the Foundation, SCP-1316 was originally classified as an anomalous object.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Every day at 09:20:37 GMT, SCP-1316 emits a radio broadcast between 4225 and 16048&nbsp;kHz for exactly five minutes. This transmission can be picked up on any standard shortwave radio. The broadcasts opens with three bars taken from the British folk ballad &quot;Tam Lin,&quot; followed by an artificially generated female voice reading a series of eighty numbers.</span> (See Addendum 1316-33m)</p>

<p>Following Incident 1316-23a, only D-class are to come into contact with SCP-1316, to reduce the likelihood of intelligence breach.</p>

<p><strong>Original Anomalous Object Entry</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Item Description: A female <em>Felis catus</em>, or common house cat, which does not age. Despite advanced age (allegedly purchased by Miss ██████ ███ in 1926), retains physical characteristics of a 3-month-old kitten.<br />
Date of Recovery: ██/██/1948<br />
Location of Recovery: ████████, ████<br />
Current Status: Contained at Site 112. Allowed free range of site outside of SCP object containment areas. Responds to &quot;Lucy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Incident 1316-23a</strong><br />
On 08/16/1952, Site 112 was attacked in a pre-dawn raid by several Chaos Insurgency strike teams. A massive security breach ensued, during which SCPs-████, -███, and -████ were stolen, -████ and -███ were destroyed, and -████, -████, and -████ disappeared. ██ Foundation personnel were killed in the course of the breach. Following standard counterintelligence practice, all Foundation personnel were debriefed and a scan of the site for bugs ensued. In addition to █ standard electronic listening devices, SCP-1316 was found to be a source of regular broadcasts. The content of these broadcasts was determined to be some manner of cipher. Movement of the subject has been restricted pending deciphering of broadcast.</p>
